            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Training Pro. We believe great practice shouldn't compromise your privacy. This policy explains exactly what happens to your data when you use our platform.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The key points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Training Pro doesn't store your conversations or training content</li>
                <li>Your messages are processed by AI services (OpenAI and ElevenLabs) to generate responses</li>
                <li>We only keep your email address for login - nothing else</li>
                <li>We recommend using fictional scenarios when practicing with sensitive topics</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="what-we-collect">2. What We DO and DON'T Collect</h2>
            
            <p><strong>What We DO Collect:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Only your email address and password (securely managed by Firebase Authentication)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>What We DON'T Store:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>‚ùå NO Conversation Storage:</strong> Training Pro doesn't save your conversations anywhere</li>
                <li><strong>‚ùå NO Voice Recordings:</strong> We don't keep any audio files</li>

            <p style="background: #fff3cd; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #ffc107;">
                <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è However:</strong> Your conversations ARE sent to OpenAI (for AI responses) and ElevenLabs (for voice synthesis) during your session. While Training Pro doesn't store this data, these services receive and process it according to their own privacy policies.
            </p>

            <h2>3. How Your Data is Used</h2>
            <p><strong>During your training session:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Your messages ‚Üí OpenAI:</strong> Sent to generate realistic interviewer responses</li>
                <li><strong>AI responses ‚Üí ElevenLabs:</strong> Sent to create voice output</li>
                <li><strong>Your voice ‚Üí Browser/Google:</strong> Processed to convert speech to text</li>
                <li><strong>Session memory:</strong> Kept temporarily in your browser to maintain conversation context</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>After your session ends:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Training Pro deletes all conversation data from browser memory</li>
                <li>We have no record of what was discussed</li>
                <li>Note: We cannot control whether third-party services retain data per their policies</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>The only permanent data we keep:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your email address (for login)</li>
                <li>Encrypted password (managed by Firebase)</li>
            </ul>

                <strong>What this means:</strong> While we design Training Pro to be privacy-focused and don't store your data ourselves, we cannot control how these third-party services handle the data they receive.

                <li>Access your account information (we only have your email address)</li>
                <li>Correct your email address</li>

            <p>To exercise these rights, please contact us at privacy@trainingpro.ai</p>
            
            <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Since we don't store training conversations, we cannot retrieve, modify, or delete past session content. Once a session ends, that data no longer exists in our systems.</p>
            
            <p style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; margin-top: 1rem;">
                <strong>Note about third-party services:</strong> If you want to exercise privacy rights regarding data processed by OpenAI or ElevenLabs, you'll need to contact them directly through their privacy policies linked in Section 4.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>Since we prioritize your privacy, here's what we actually retain:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account information:</strong> Only kept until you delete your account</li>
                <li><strong>Training conversations:</strong> NEVER stored - deleted instantly when session ends</li>
                <li><strong>Voice recordings:</strong> NEVER stored - processed and immediately discarded</li>
                <li><strong>Performance data:</strong> NEVER stored - exists only during your active session</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you delete your account, all your data (just your email and authentication info) is permanently removed from our systems.</p>

            <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Training Pro is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

            <h2>9. Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
            <p>We use minimal browser storage:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Firebase Authentication:</strong> Uses secure cookies to keep you logged in</li>
                <li><strong>Session Data:</strong> Temporary browser memory only - cleared when you close the tab</li>
                <li><strong>No Tracking:</strong> We don't use analytics or advertising cookies</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>10. Legal Requests and Compliance</h2>
            <p>If we receive a legal request for user data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We can only provide what we have: email addresses and account creation dates</li>
                <li>We cannot provide training conversations because we don't store them</li>
                <li>However, authorities could potentially request data from OpenAI or ElevenLabs directly</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is another reason we recommend using fictional scenarios for sensitive practice.</p>

            <h2 id="best-practices">12. Best Practices for Sensitive Information</h2>
            <div style="background: #d1ecf1; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 10px; border: 1px solid #bee5eb;">
                <p><strong>To maximize your privacy when practicing:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use fictional names instead of real people</li>
                    <li>Change company names and specific details</li>
                    <li>Alter numbers and dates slightly</li>
                    <li>Focus on the type of situation rather than exact details</li>
                    <li>Practice the dynamics and responses, not the exact confidential content</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Instead of "preparing for testimony about the XYZ merger," practice "preparing for testimony about a major acquisition." The skills transfer perfectly without the sensitive details.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Treat Training Pro like any online service - don't share anything you wouldn't want processed by third-party AI services.</p>

            <div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 10px; margin-top: 1rem;">
                <p><strong>Q: Can my employer/others see my training sessions?</strong><br>
                A: No. Training Pro doesn't store sessions, so we cannot share them with anyone.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Q: What happens to sensitive information I discuss during training?</strong><br>
                A: Training Pro doesn't save it, but it IS sent to OpenAI and ElevenLabs to generate responses. Please review their privacy policies if you're concerned about sensitive data.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Q: Do you use my conversations to train AI models?</strong><br>
